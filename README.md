# 💧SmartWaterPump

## 📌 Description
SmartWaterPump is an IoT-based system that monitors tank water levels and controls the pump automatically. It turns the pump ON when water is low and OFF when full, preventing overflow and saving electricity. Simple, low-cost, and reliable, it’s ideal for both home and industrial water management.

👉 Simple, low-cost, and easy to deploy in both **household** and **industrial** setups.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Automatic pump ON/OFF  
- ✅ Real-time water level detection  
- ✅ Prevents overflow & dry running  
- ✅ Saves electricity & water  
- ✅ Easy to install and maintain  
- ✅ Compatible with Arduino / ESP boards

## 🛠️ Components Used
- ESP32  
- Ultrasonic Sensor 
- 1-Channel Relay Module  
- 12V DC Pump (or AC motor with relay)  
- Power Supply  
- Jumper Wires & Breadboard

## 📐 Working Principle
1. Sensor continuously measures the tank water level.  
2. If water falls **below minimum threshold** → Pump **turns ON**.  
3. If water reaches **maximum threshold** → Pump **turns OFF**.  
4. System prevents **overflow** and **dry run**.
