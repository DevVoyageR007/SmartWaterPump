# SmartWaterPump
SmartWaterPump is an IoT-based system that monitors tank water levels and controls the pump automatically. It turns the pump ON when water is low and OFF when full, preventing overflow and saving electricity. Simple, low-cost, and reliable, itâ€™s ideal for both home and industrial water management.
